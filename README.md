Project Overview
The Advanced Command-Line Task Manager will allow users to manage tasks through a command-line interface with enhanced features such as due dates, reminders, collaboration, and reporting. The project supports multiple programming languages, giving you the ﬂexibility to use the one you are most comfortable with.
Milestone 1: Core Functionality Implementation
Objective: Implement the basic functionalities of the task manager.
Tasks:
Task Data Structure:
Deﬁne a class or data structure to store tasks with attributes like title, description, priority, status, and due date.
Example: In Python, use a class; in Java, use a POJO (Plain Old Java Object).
Add Task Functionality:
Write a function to add new tasks to the data structure, including due dates and tags.
Validate user input to ensure required ﬁelds are provided.
View Tasks Functionality:
Implement a function to display all tasks with details and status.
Use a library for better formatting (e.g., rich for Python, chalk for Node.js).
Update Task Functionality:
Create a function to update the details of an existing task (e.g., mark as complete, change due date).
Ensure updates are reﬂected immediately in the task list.
Delete Task Functionality:
Implement a function to remove tasks from the data structure.
Conﬁrm deletion with the user to prevent accidental removal.
Milestone 2: Advanced Task Management Features
Objective: Add advanced functionalities to enhance the task manager.
Tasks:
Due Dates and Reminders:
Implement functionality to set due dates for tasks and send reminders.
Use a scheduling library suitable for your chosen language.
Recurring Tasks:
Allow users to create recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly).
Automatically generate new task instances based on the recurrence pattern.
Tags and Labels:
Enable users to tag tasks for better organization and ﬁltering.
Implement ﬁltering functionality based on tags.
Search Functionality:
Write a function to search for tasks by title, status, or tags.
Ensure search results are displayed in a user-friendly format.
Sorting Tasks:
Implement sorting options to order tasks by priority or due date.
Allow users to choose the sorting criteria.
Milestone 3: Data Persistence and Backup
Objective: Implement data persistence and backup features.
Tasks:
Database Integration:
Integrate a lightweight database like SQLite (for Python) or use ﬁle-based storage (e.g., JSON for JavaScript).
Write functions to save and retrieve tasks from the database.
Backup and Restore:
Implement functionality to backup the database to a ﬁle.
Allow users to restore tasks from a backup ﬁle.
Download Tasks Functionality:
Create a function to export tasks to a CSV or JSON ﬁle for download.
Ensure the exported ﬁle is formatted correctly.
Milestone 4: Collaboration and Reporting
Objective: Add collaboration features and reporting capabilities.
Tasks:
Multi-User Support:
Implement user authentication to allow multiple users.
Ensure tasks are associated with the correct user.
Task Assignment:
Enable users to assign tasks to other users.
Implement notiﬁcations for task assignments and updates.
Task Statistics:
Generate reports on task completion rates, overdue tasks, and time spent.
Use a library suitable for your language to create visualizations (e.g., matplotlib for Python).
Visualizations:
Create graphs and charts to represent task data visually.
Ensure visualizations are clear and informative.
Milestone 5: User Customization and Error Handling
Objective: Enhance user experience and ensure robust error handling.
Tasks:
Custom Themes:
Allow users to customize the appearance of the command-line interface.
Implement themes using conﬁguration ﬁles.
Settings Conﬁguration:
Provide a conﬁguration ﬁle where users can set their preferences.
Ensure settings are applied correctly on startup.
Robust Error Handling:
Implement comprehensive error handling for all functions.
Provide clear error messages to the user.
Milestone 6: Testing, Documentation, and Deployment
Objective: Ensure reliability, create documentation, and prepare for deployment.
Tasks:
Unit Testing:
Write unit tests for each function using a testing framework suitable for your language (e.g., unittest for Python, JUnit for Java).
Ensure all edge cases are covered.
Integration Testing:
Test the integration of all functions to ensure they work together seamlessly.
Address any integration issues that arise.
Documentation Creation:
Write comprehensive documentation, including usage instructions.
Ensure documentation is clear and accessible.
Dockerization:
Package the application using Docker for easier deployment.
Provide instructions for setting up the application in dierent environments.
Gather User Feedback:
Share the application with users to gather feedback for future improvements.
